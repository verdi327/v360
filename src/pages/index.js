          Iâ€™m a veteran and a small business owner. Iâ€™m also a Maryland native.
          I grew up in Baltimore County. I went to school at McDaniel College
          and for the last 25 years Iâ€™ve been running marketing campaigns for
          businesses - focusing on direct mail and non profit fundraising.
        </p>

        <p>I like it here.</p>

        <p>
          I like my neighbors, my employees and the clients I get to work with.
          But, like most Marylanders, I think we can do better. While I believe
          each individual should be the change they wish to see, I think some
          problems have to be addressed at the political level.
        </p>

        <p>
          Iâ€™m no politician but what I do know is marketing. I know that to
          connect with someone, you actually need to know something about them.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          Marketing campaigns fail when companies sound too generic; trying to
          be everything to everyone. To a consumer, it seems inauthenticate.
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          You know this, but up until now, you didnâ€™t know it possible to
          connect with your constituents in a personalized way that is both cost
          effective and scalable. Leading brands tailor their marketing based
          off hundreds of data points on a given individual, political campaigns
          should be doing the same.
        </p>

        <p>
          Unfortunately, many are not and weâ€™re still stuck in the age of the
          one-size-fits-all, spray and pray campaigns that hope if you can just
          get your name in front of someone enough times they might remember you
          at the polls.
        </p>

        <p>
          I know we can do better and I started Victory360 specifically to help
          the right candidate win.
        </p>

        <h3>Whatâ€™s the value of a single vote?</h3>

        <p>
          Consider the recent Democratic primary for Baltimore County Executive.
          Johnny Olszewski won the bid by 17 votes, a margin of less than 0.1
          percent. As races become closer, it will be candidates that are able
          to connect with their voters that win, not those with the largest
          budgets.
        </p>

        <h3>Let's Meet</h3>
